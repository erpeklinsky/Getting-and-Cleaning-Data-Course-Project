# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. This submission includes: 1) a tidy data set as described by the assignment, 2) a link to my Github repository with the script for performing my analysis, and 3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations that was performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. 

The R script called run_analysis.R does the following. 

Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The codebook file (codebook.md) describes the data, variables and the work done to get a clean dataset.
